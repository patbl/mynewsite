<h3>Bush Cow Milk</h3>
<br>
<div class='well'>
Howard Benedict Hayes, to whom Parker dedicates this song, was "<a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001341/134147fo.pdf">a musical genius, a great songwriter and performer, though blind from birth.</a>" According to <a href="http://mw4.m-w.com/dictionary/bush%20cow">Merriam-Webster's online dictionary</a> 
a bush cow is either a short-horned buffalo of West Africa (<i>Syncerus nanus</i>) or a tapir.

  "Bush Cow Milk," by the late  Prof. Howard Benedict Hayes, rearranged, played, and sung by Congress-Woman Jackson Parker. Dedicated to the three brothers, William, Frank, and Steve <span class="unsure">Talbot</span>.

<div class="lyrics">
A lovely girl of some degree <span class="unsure">[?]</span>
He bought her satin and he bought her silk:
things of quality.
She said, "I don't like satin and I don't want silk,
but all I want is some bush cow milk.
So please go down and milk a bush cow for me."

Now that made <span class="unsure">[?]</span> stand still
and he said, "Sweetheart, I will."

When the sun shine above
start getting hot,
lepers are born without any spots
when a great big ship <span class="unsure">stop</span> crossing the sea.

Elephants [?] coconut trees.
When <span class="unsure">motor-scooters</span> take flight
and say, "Man, I ain't gonna bite."
Sweetheart, I'm telling you too:

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
you find one woman a man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
you find one woman a that man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When the clouds of above
stop descending <span class="unsure">to</span> rain
and <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/505536/Joseph-Jenkins-Roberts">Joseph Jenkins Roberts</a> is president again,
<span class="unsure">yeah</span>, I'll, I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When a <span class="unsure">strain of</span> sand turn to dust,
find one man that a woman can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

  Now <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/505536/Joseph-Jenkins-Roberts">Roberts</a> was Liberia's first president. <a href="http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/William%20Tubman.htm">Tubman</a> is Liberia's eighteenth president. This republic is the oldest independent republic in Africa, and has made more progress in the last decade than in the preceding century.

<div class="lyrics">
When every grain of sand turn to dust
find one man that a woman can trust
<span class="unsure">then</span> I'll milk, I'll milk a bush cow for you

When the clouds of above <span class="unsure">stop descending to rain</span>
and Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
I'll milk, I'll milk, I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
find one man that a woman can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

<span class="unsure">Well, clouds above stop descending to rain</span>
Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

Says Bill: "It's impossible to milk a bush cow."

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
find one woman that a man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When the clouds of above <span class="unsure">stop descending to rain</span>
and Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
<span class="unsure">well,</span>  I'll milk a bush cow for you.

Impossible.
