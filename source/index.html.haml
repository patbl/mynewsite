    %p Hi! I'm Patrick. I'm a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. |
      I don't usually wear a suit, but I have few suitable photos of myself. |

    %p I'm part of the #{link_to "effective-altruist movement", "http://www.effectivealtruism.org/"}, |
      which aims to improve the world in the most effective ways possible. If you're into this sort of |
      thing, check out #{link_to("EARadio", "https://earad.io/")}, my podcast that aggregates talks |
      related to effective altruism. |
