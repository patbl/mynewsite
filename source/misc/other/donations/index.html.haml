%p
  This is a mostly complete list of donations I've made since 2012.
  (Earlier donations were relatively small and I didn't keep track of
  them.)

%p
  Both contributions to and grants from The Eleemosynary Flying
  Orang−Utans Fund, my now-defunct donor-advised fund, are listed
  below. I included only my contributions to the fund in the "Total
  Donated" figure.

%p
  In 2016, I decided to direct the majority of my donations to a
  donor-advised fund run by two knowledgeable, trusted acquaintances.
  One of them—Nick Beckstead—describes the arrangement <a
  href="http://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/09/staff-members-personal-donations-giving-season-2016/">here</a>
  (to be clear, I am not the "private individual" referred to):

%blockquote.blockquote{style: "font-size: 14px;"} Since 2012, one of my side projects has been working with a private individual (who has provided the vast majority of the funds and prefers to remain anonymous) to make donations to organizations working in the effective altruism space and organizations working on mitigating global catastrophic risks (especially potential risks from advanced AI). We meet every three weeks to discuss potential donation opportunities and make decisions, and we both keep up with activities in the space through relationships we’ve built up over time. The DAF is jointly controlled by me and this partner.

%p
  The EA Giving Group DAF has been superseded by the Effective
  Alturism Community Fund and the Long-Term Future Fund (also
  administered by Nick Beckstead), which I have donated to more
  recently.
