<div class="lyrics">
A lovely girl of some degree <span class="unsure">[?]</span>
He bought her satin and he bought her silk:
things of quality.
She said, "I don't like satin and I don't want silk,
but all I want is some bush cow milk.
So please go down and milk a bush cow for me."

Now that made <span class="unsure">[?]</span> stand still
and he said, "Sweetheart, I will."

When the sun shine above
start getting hot,
lepers are born without any spots
when a great big ship <span class="unsure">stop</span> crossing the sea.

Elephants [?] coconut trees.
When <span class="unsure">motor-scooters</span> take flight
and say, "Man, I ain't gonna bite."
Sweetheart, I'm telling you too:

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
you find one woman a man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
you find one woman a that man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When the clouds of above
stop descending <span class="unsure">to</span> rain
and <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/505536/Joseph-Jenkins-Roberts">Joseph Jenkins Roberts</a> is president again,
<span class="unsure">yeah</span>, I'll, I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When a <span class="unsure">strain of</span> sand turn to dust,
find one man that a woman can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

<div class="lyrics">
When every grain of sand turn to dust
find one man that a woman can trust
<span class="unsure">then</span> I'll milk, I'll milk a bush cow for you

When the clouds of above <span class="unsure">stop descending to rain</span>
and Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
I'll milk, I'll milk, I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
find one man that a woman can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

<span class="unsure">Well, clouds above stop descending to rain</span>
Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

Says Bill: "It's impossible to milk a bush cow."

When every grain of sand turn to dust,
find one woman that a man can trust,
I'll milk a bush cow for you.

When the clouds of above <span class="unsure">stop descending to rain</span>
and Joseph Jenkins Roberts is president again,
<span class="unsure">well,</span>  I'll milk a bush cow for you.

Impossible.
